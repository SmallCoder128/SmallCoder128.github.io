I am a sophomore at Chaminade University of Honolulu, Majoring in Data Science, Analytics, and Visualization. I have a background in chocolate production, and endeavor to make a career from my education. As of my Sophomore year I have learned SQL, R, and Python and have completed multiple classes in topics surrounding my major. I have also had the opportunity to participate in multiple data research internships which have cemented my decision to continue with my major.
